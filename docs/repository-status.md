## 🚨 Critical Issues (Address Now)

**None!** ✅ All games are built and ready for deployment.

---

## ⚠️ Warnings (Address Soon)

### 1. esbuild Security Vulnerability (Development Only)
- **Severity**: Moderate (CVSS 5.3, dev-only dependency)
- **Issue**: esbuild <=0.24.2 vulnerable to cross-origin requests on dev server
- **Package**: esbuild@0.21.5 (transitive dependency via Vite 5.4.21)
- **Impact**:
  - ⚠️ Dev server could be accessed by malicious websites
  - ✅ Production builds unaffected (vulnerability only in dev server)
  - ✅ Low risk (requires local dev environment running)
- **Fix**: Update to esbuild >=0.25.0 (requires Vite update)
- **Advisory**: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- **Action**: Consider updating Vite to latest version (5.x or 7.x)
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours (includes testing all 18 games)
- **Priority**: Low-Medium (dev-only, low practical risk)

### 2. Dependencies Have Major Updates Available
- **Severity**: Low-Medium
- **Count**: Multiple packages with updates available
- **Major Updates Available**:
  - React 18.3.1 → 19.2.1 (⚠️ breaking changes)
  - Vite 5.4.21 → 7.2.6 (⚠️ breaking changes)
  - ESLint 8.57.1 → 9.39.1 (⚠️ breaking - new config format)
  - @types/node 20.19.25 → 24.10.1 (major)
  - TypeScript 5.9.3 (minor update available)
- **Action**: Plan and test major version updates
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for full upgrade and testing
- **Why**: Major version bumps require careful testing of all 18 games
- **Priority**: Low (current versions work fine)

### 3. ESLint Configuration Migration Needed
- **Severity**: Low
- **Issue**: Using old .eslintrc.js format (ESLint 8)
- **Impact**: ESLint 9 requires new eslint.config.js format
- **Current**: Can't run `pnpm lint` due to config format mismatch
- **Action**: Migrate to new ESLint flat config format
- **Guide**: https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide
- **Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes
- **Priority**: Low-Medium (blocking linting, but TypeScript catches most issues)

### 4. Accessibility Audit Never Run
- **Last Audit**: Never
- **Action**: Run accessibility checklist on 2-3 games
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours (can split into sessions)
- **Why**: Educational sites must be accessible to all students
- **Priority**: High (educational context)

### 5. Performance Baseline Needed
- **Last Audit**: Never
- **Action**: Run Lighthouse on 2-3 games
- **Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
- **Why**: Establish performance budget and track bundle sizes
- **Note**: Current bundles are 169-212KB (under or near 250KB target) ✅
- **Priority**: Medium

# Individual checks
pnpm check:security    # Check for vulnerabilities (✅ working)
pnpm check:deps        # Check for outdated dependencies (✅ working)
pnpm check:quality     # TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier (⚠️ ESLint needs migration)
pnpm type-check        # TypeScript only (✅ passing)
pnpm format:check      # Formatting check (✅ all files compliant)
pnpm check:all         # Run all checks (takes longer)

# Code formatting
pnpm format            # Auto-format all files (✅ working)
pnpm format:check      # Check formatting (✅ working)

# Linting (needs ESLint migration)
pnpm lint              # Check for linting issues (⚠️ needs config migration)
pnpm lint:fix          # Auto-fix linting issues (⚠️ needs config migration)

# Build commands
pnpm build             # Build all games (✅ working)
pnpm dev               # Start development server (✅ working)

pnpm --filter @kvenno/nafnakerfid dev     # Run specific game dev server
pnpm --filter './games/**' build          # Build all games
```

**Notes**:
- ✅ TypeScript, Prettier, and security checks working perfectly
- ⚠️ ESLint requires migration to flat config format (30-60 min task)
- ✅ All build and dev commands functional

Or simply ask Claude:
- "What's the deployment status?" (✅ ready!)
- "Run security audit" (✅ working)
- "What needs attention?" (ESLint migration, accessibility audit)
- "Update the repository status" (you're reading it!)
- "Quick daily check" (use Master Checklist System)

## 💡 ADHD-Friendly Tips

### When Overwhelmed
1. **Just do the Daily Check** (5 min) - that's enough!
2. **Pick ONE Quick Win** - not all of them
3. **Set a timer** - when it rings, you're done
4. **Celebrate small wins** - updated one metric? That's progress!

### When Hyperfocusing
- ✅ Great time for quarterly audits
- ✅ Perfect for deep-dive performance optimization
- ⚠️ Set a timer so you don't burn out
- ⚠️ Remember to eat and drink water!

### When You Can't Focus
- Skip it! It's okay!
- Come back tomorrow
- Or just ask Claude: "Quick status check"

### Making It Stick
- **Same time daily**: Coffee + quick check = habit
- **Visual cue**: Bookmark this file
- **Automation**: Let scripts do the work
- **Forgiveness**: Missed a week? No problem, just resume
